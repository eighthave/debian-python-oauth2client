Description: OAuth 2.0 client library
 The oauth2client is a client library for OAuth 2.0.
 .
 OAuth is an open standard for authorization. OAuth provides a method for
 clients to access server resources on behalf of a resource owner (such as a
 different client or an end-user). It also provides a process for end-users to
 authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their
 credentials (typically, a username and password pair), using user-agent
 redirections.
 .
 OAuth is a service that is complementary to, and therefore distinct from,
 OpenID. OAuth is also distinct from OATH, which is a reference architecture
 for authentication (i.e. not a standard).
